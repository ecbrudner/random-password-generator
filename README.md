## Description

I created this random password generator to ensure password strength in order to protect the user's sensitive data. Using an app to create a truly randomized password will result in a much higher level of security than any password made up by a human. In creating this app, I learned how to break down a complex problem into many smaller pieces to address each piece with code. Building this app gave me the opportunity to translate logic into conditionals, create a function from scratch in JavaScript, utilize an array and practice for loops.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

In order to use my app, the user will do the following:
-Click the 'Generate Password' button
-Enter the desired length for their password
-Answer prompts to indicate which type(s) of characters they want to include in the password
-Copy the randomly generated password for their use
